This is not worth reading, and you should really not continue.
The fact that you are still reading this says more about you than it does about me, i just write...
Honestly what the goal for me is here, that's really none of your concern and I tell you this because you're still wasting time reading.
Don't you realize yet that this is nothing but filling out the document with as many sentences and words as possible?
The funny part about it all is that no matter what I say at this point you will keep on reading because of your own curiosity.
It's rather amusing to me how even after all these years since the sentence "The cake is a lie" became viral, people still have the hope that it isn't.
The grass aint greener on the other side, frankly due to the fact that grass doesn't grow on the internet if you didn't realize.
Question yourself who is in the position of power when you are STILL reading this completely pointless text after 8 sentences.
Aren't you going to realize soon that I have written absolutely nothing here, that you have read this far without actually reading anything.
Please tell me what you learnt from this introduction.
